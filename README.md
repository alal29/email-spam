SMS Spam Detection
This project builds an end-to-end SMS spam detection classifier using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and scikit-learn. It preprocesses text messages, converts them into numerical features with TF-IDF, trains multiple machine learning models, and evaluates their performance on a real SMS Spam/Ham dataset.
